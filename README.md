# eWeb Techs

This repository is prepared to hold the files for the `ewebtechs.com` site.

The `public_html` directory is currently empty (a `.gitkeep` file keeps the folder
under version control). To include your actual site files:

1. Delete the `.gitkeep` if present: `rm public_html/.gitkeep`.
2. Copy your website files into the `public_html/` directory.
3. Run `git add public_html` to stage them.
4. Commit the files: `git commit -m "Add site files"`.
5. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main` (use `--force` if overwriting).

This README was added from Codex environment which cannot connect to the
original server or GitHub, so you must perform the above steps on a machine
with network access.
